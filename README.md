I developed this mobile application using HTML5, CSS and Responsive Bootstrap as my first freecodecamp.org project. Feel free to take and use as a template. I've included a couple screenshots in the repository so you get a feel for what it looks like. 

There are a couple libraries you need to make this run correctly: 

1) Bootstrap: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/4.0.0-alpha.6/css/bootstrap.min.css
2) FontAwesome: https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.5.0/css/font-awesome.min.css

If you have any questions feel free to reachout, Aaron.
